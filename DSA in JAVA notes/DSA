DATA STRUCTURES
  A Data Structure is particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectivly.
  Ex :- We can store a list of items having the same data-types using the array daya structures.
  
  Data Structures :- 
                      1) Linear DS
                          - Arrays
                          - Linked List
                          - Stack
                          - Queue
                       
                     2) Non-Linear DS
                          - Tree
                          - Graph
                          
                          
ALGORITHMS
  An Algorithms id set of instructions tp perform a task or to slove a given problem.
  Ex:- Print average of 3 given numbers
        
        Step1 :- perform sum of 3 numbers
        Step2 :- store it in a variable sum.
        Step3 :- Divide the sum by 3
        Step4 :- store the value in variable in avg
        Step5 :- print the value stored in avg.
