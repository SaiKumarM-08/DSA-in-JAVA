Time Complexity
      The amount of time taken by Algorithm to run, the input processed by an Algorithm helps in determining the time Complexity.
      
      Example:- file...
      
      Note :- Analysis of Algorithm, there are different mathematical tools which can help us determining Time Complexity.
      
      
      
Space Complexity
      the amount of memory or space taken by Algorithm to run.
      
      The memory required to process the input by an algorithm help in determining the Space Complexity.
