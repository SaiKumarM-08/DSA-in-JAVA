Analysis of Algorithms:

        Analysis of Algorithms deals in finding best Algorithm which runs fast and less memory.
        
        Analysis of Algorithms. 
            A complete analysis of the running time of an algorithm involves the following steps:
                   * Implement the algorithm completely.
                   * Determine the time required for each basic operation.
                   * Identify unknown quantities that can be used to describe the frequency of execution of the basic operations.
                   * Develop a realistic model for the input to the program.
                   * Analyze the unknown quantities, assuming the modelled input.
                   * Calculate the total running time by multiplying the time by the frequency for each operation, then adding all the products.
                   
       Example :- Find sum of n natural numbers.
                  
                                      A 
                  public void findSum(int n){ 
                        return n * ( n + 1 ) / 2;                     // O(1)
                        }
                        
                        
                                      B
                  public void findSum(int n){
                        int sum = 0;
                        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){                 // O(n)
                            sum += i;
                            }
                        return sum;
                        }
